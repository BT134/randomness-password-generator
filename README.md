# JavaScript Password Generator - Week 3 Homework

## Desciption

> I was tasked with creating a random password generator utilising JavaScript to do all the heavy lifting. The HTML and CSS files were already created and it was a matter of creating the JavaScript to work in with both these files and their code. 

## Clients Request
```md
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
